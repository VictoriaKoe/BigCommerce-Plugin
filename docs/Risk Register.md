# **1\. Introduction** {#1.-introduction}

Risk management consists of five key phases:

1. **Risk Identification**: Identify potential risks that could impact the project's outcome.

2. **Risk Analysis**: Assess and prioritize risks based on their likelihood of occurring and the severity of their potential impact.

3. **Risk Response Planning**: Develop strategies and action plans to mitigate the threats posed by specific risks to project objectives.

4. **Risk Monitoring and Control**: Continuously monitor, analyse, and reassess risks. This phase ensures that previously identified risks are tracked and managed effectively, while newly identified risks are addressed. It involves verifying the effectiveness of planned risk responses and keeping the project team updated on risk status.

5. **Risk Mitigation**: Focuses on minimizing the likelihood or impact of risks through proactive strategies, including:  
   * **Avoidance**: Eliminating the risk by changing plans, processes, or objectives.  
   * **Reduction**: Implementing measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.  
   * **Transfer**: Shifting the risk to a third party better equipped to handle it.  
   * **Acceptance**: Acknowledging the risk and accepting it when the cost of mitigation exceeds the cost of facing the risk.

| R01 | 14/04/2025 | Inadequate programming language proficiency | Possible | Intolerable | 11 | Team members are inexperienced in developing a plugin and the BigCommerce platform in general, which causes delay in development progress early on. | Official BigCommerce documentations, team discussions, technical setup documentations by proficient team members and AI are all used in learning plugin development and the BigCommerce platform. | Scrum Team |
| R05 | 14/05/2024 | Integration challenges | Possible  | Intolerable  | 12 | Integration based on the client's ideal solution is explored and deemed impossible at the current stage of development due to challenges in plugin integration and platform limitations.  | Time is spent on exploring options and alternatives. Options and alternatives are presented to the clients and an alternative is decided before proceeding. | Scrum Team |
| R11 | 16/5/2024 | Lack of version control discipline  | Probable | Extreme | 12 | Some, but not all commits in this milestone were not following the version control guidelines established in the Quality Assurance Plan. Despite no serious issues found in this milestone, it is for the betterment of our team that we should bring this risk up as it is still likely to happen. | Version control practices are established  and the use of code branching strategy is applied to avoid overwritten code and facilitate collaboration. Regular code reviews and pull requests, along with enforcing clear commit messages when pushing changes to the repository resolved this risk. | Scrum Team |
| R16 | 14/04/2024 | Requirements specification incomplete or unclear  | Possible | Intolerable | 11 | Insufficient clarity in the initial requirements specification at the start of the milestone resulted in the team designing the product in a way that did not align with the client's expectations. | Client feedback was incorporated to revise the requirement specification, which in turn informed updates to all relevant design artefacts. | Scrum Team |
