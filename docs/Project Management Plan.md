# **1\. Project Overview** {#1.-project-overview}

## 1.1 Project Description {#1.1-project-description}

Chessworld, a premium online retailer specializing in chess-related products, requires a robust inventory management solution for its **BigCommerce** store. The project aims to develop a **custom plugin** that enables accurate **SKU-level inventory tracking** while supporting product bundling. The plugin will ensure that bundled products—composed of multiple SKUs—are correctly tracked to prevent overselling. By seamlessly integrating with BigCommerce’s existing product and order management system, the solution will provide an intuitive interface for managing bundled SKUs efficiently. This will enhance Chessworld’s ability to manage inventory in real-time, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers while maintaining operational efficiency.

## 1.2 Problem Statement {#1.2-problem-statement}

Chessworld sells chess sets that often consist of multiple SKUs from different manufacturers, such as chess boards and chess pieces, which can be sold separately or as part of a bundle. However, **BigCommerce lacks native support for SKU-level inventory tracking within bundled products**, leading to **overselling risks** when a shared SKU runs out of stock. The current system does not synchronize inventory across bundles and individual SKUs, creating potential stock discrepancies. This gap in inventory management affects order fulfillment accuracy and operational efficiency. Chessworld needs a solution that allows **independent SKU tracking within bundles**, ensuring inventory accuracy and preventing overselling while maintaining seamless integration with BigCommerce.

## 1.3 Project High Level Objectives {#1.3-project-high-level-objectives}

* Develop a BigCommerce plugin to manage bundled products with accurate SKU tracking.  
* Enable seamless SKU synchronization across individual products and bundles.  
* Prevent overselling when a shared SKU is out of stock.  
* Provide a simple and intuitive user interface for inventory management.

### 

## 1.4 Project Vision {#1.4-project-vision}

Our plugin is designed to support Chess World by enabling independent SKU tracking within bundled products. With real-time SKU-level tracking and automatic stock synchronization between individual SKUs and bundles, it removes the need for manual updates and significantly reduces the risk of overselling. Unlike Smart Manager, our plugin offers automated, SKU-level inventory tracking tailored specifically for bundled products.

Seamlessly integrated with BigCommerce, the plugin improves order fulfillment accuracy and streamlines operations, directly addressing Chess World's current challenges in managing SKU-level inventory.

In addition, the plugin features a clean, spreadsheet-style interface that makes inventory management intuitive and efficient. Its simple, minimalist design delivers an all-in-one solution that prioritizes ease of use and operational excellence for Chess World.

4. Progress updates are expected from all members on Discord.  
5. Work status and time should be logged in Google Excel and Trello’s integrated time-tracker.   
6. Each member should inform the group via communication if they are unable to attend any supervision team meetings or client meetings.  
7. Client meeting absentees should take responsibility for sending an apology email to the client.

# **3\. Process Model Framework** {#3.-process-model-framework}

The process framework adopted for this project is primarily focused on Scrum, an Agile framework commonly used for team collaboration on complex projects. Scrum applies Agile principles, with a focus on transparency, inspection, and adaptation. It uses an iterative and incremental approach, dividing work into sprints.

In this framework, there is a single team known as the Scrum team, which is a self-organising and cross-functional team. The Scrum team consists of three main roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers. The Product Owner is responsible for defining the product vision, prioritizing requirements, and managing the product backlog. The Scrum Master ensures the Scrum process is strictly followed and is responsible for turning high-quality work into value that addresses the product backlog during each sprint. The Developers are responsible for completing all tasks within each sprint and ensuring a shippable product at the end of each iteration.

The Scrum artefacts in this project center around the product backlog, which includes all requirements, user stories, testing, and non-functional requirements. The Product Owner manages and prioritises the product backlog based on value. This enables the team to conduct sprint planning and execute sprints more efficiently, ultimately enhancing project outcomes.

The key Scrum ceremonies for our Scrum Team are conducted with some adjustments to suit the academic timeline. To better manage our workload, our team has introduced 'milestones' to structure our progress.Scrum practices will be applied within each milestone, with each sprint lasting approximately two weeks. There will be a total of four milestones, comprising twelve sprints in total until the project completion. Additionally, we will rotate the main roles and responsibilities each sprint to ensure all team members gain experience in each role's demands.

Due to the challenges posed by individual team members' various commitments and time constraints, our team will hold stand-up meetings once a week, lasting approximately 1 hour. These meetings facilitate progress updates, address issues, and discuss potential solutions.

All Scrum practices, including sprint retrospectives and sprint reviews, will be conducted at the end of each sprint.
